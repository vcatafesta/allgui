General guidances for publishing samples

Always credit the authors and contributors.
Always state the type of license, if any applies to the code. We recommend The Code Project Open License (CPOL) 1.02.
If your sample needs third party files, state so and include a working link to them.
Although you can use any language, try to write in English because ooHG is used worldwide.
Include as many comments as needed to make the sample comprehensible.
